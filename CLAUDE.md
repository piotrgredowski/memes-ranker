# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Python project called "memes-ranker" configured with modern Python packaging using pyproject.toml. The project is in its initial stage with minimal code structure.

## Development Setup

- **Python Version**: Requires Python >=3.13.0
- **Package Manager**: Uses standard Python packaging with pyproject.toml
- **Current Dependencies**: None specified yet

## Common Commands

Since this is a new project without build tools configured yet, standard Python commands apply:

```bash
# Run the main module
python hello.py

# Install in development mode (when dependencies are added)
pip install -e .
```

## Project Structure

- `hello.py` - Entry point with basic main function
- `pyproject.toml` - Project configuration and metadata
- `README.md` - Project documentation (currently empty)

## Architecture Notes

This is a minimal Python project structure. The main application logic is currently in `hello.py` with a simple main function. As the project grows, consider organizing code into proper modules and packages.
